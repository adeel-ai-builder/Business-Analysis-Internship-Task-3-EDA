# Business Analysis Internship – Task 3  
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains **Task 3** of my **Business Analysis Internship** at **Saiket Systems**.  

The task focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns in customer billing behavior and its relationship with customer churn.

## 👤 Intern Information

- **Name:** Adeel Khan
  
- **Role:** Business Analysis Intern
  
- **Company:** Saiket Systems  

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this task is to:

- Explore customer billing patterns using statistical measures
  
- Visualize the distribution of monthly charges
  
- Compare billing behavior between churned and non-churned customers
  
- Identify insights that may influence churn and retention strategies

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Dataset:** Telco Customer Churn Dataset
  
- **Input File:** `cleaned_telco_customer_churn.csv`
  
- **Primary Column Analyzed:** `monthlycharges`
  
- **Records:** 7,043 customers  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python
  
- Pandas
  
- Matplotlib
  
- VS Code

## 🧩 Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Statistical Measures

- Calculated **mean** and **median** of monthly charges to understand central tendency.

### 2️⃣ Histogram Analysis

- A histogram was created to visualize the distribution of monthly charges.
  
- Customers are grouped into **low and high charge ranges**, rather than being evenly distributed.

### 3️⃣ Box Plot Analysis

- Box plots were used to analyze:
  
  - Median monthly charges
    
  - Spread and variability
    
  - Extreme billing values

### 4️⃣ Churn Comparison Analysis

- Monthly charges were compared between:
  
  - **Churned customers**
    
  - **Non-churned customers**
    
- Box plots were used to identify differences in billing behavior.

## 📈 Key Insights

- Most customers fall into **low and high monthly charge groups**
  
- Customers who **churn tend to have higher monthly charges**
  
- Median monthly charges are higher for churned customers
  
- Very high monthly charges may increase churn risk
